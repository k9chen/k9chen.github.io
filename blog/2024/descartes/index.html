Yet there is an unpopularized story about the romance shared between Descartes and Princess Christina, a member of the House of Vasa who would eventually become the Queen of Sweden. For context, Descartes was originally a Frenchman but sought refuge in Sweden in an attempt to escape persecution from the Louise royal family of the House of Bourbon. There, Descartes had no luck in finding a proper job due to his perceived status as a fugitive, but he continued to pursue his mathematical endeavors nevertheless. This thus serves as the premise of Descartes’ poignant love story, a story that has manifested itself as one of Descartes’ most prominent contributions to mathematics. Hence, the story unfolded in the following manner, with some minor details omitted for the sake of brevity:</p> <h3 id="act-i">Act I</h3> <p>On one afternoon, perhaps it was due to pure coincidence or fate, Descartes was sitting on the streets of Stockholm indulging in his analytical studies when a carriage appeared in front of him; inside was the distinguished, young Princess Christina of Sweden, who had an interest in mathematics and inquired Descartes about his work with great respect and admiration. In turn, Descartes, who was initially unaware of the girl that stood before him, took notice of the princess’ potential for mathematics. The princess eventually departed as Descartes returned to his studies in the ensuing days.</p> <h3 id="act-ii">Act II</h3> <p>Following Descartes’ first encounter with the princess, he was soon appointed to the royal court as Princess Christina’s mathematics teacher on the order of the king. As a sign of his gratitude, Descartes dedicated himself to teach the princess his wealth of mathematical knowledge, including the Cartesian coordinate system which reconciled the relationship between algebraic formulations and geometric curves. The time that the two had spent together not only saw an improvement in Princess Christina’s mathematics abilities, but there also appears to be a much deeper connection between the two, partially due to the princess’ admiration toward Descartes’ talent, and they quickly realized it was a pure sense of love that had sprouted while paying no mind to their drastic differences in social standing and age (\(&gt; 30\) years). The king, however, quickly became informed about the love affair between his daughter and Descartes as words spread like wildfire.</p> <h3 id="act-iii">Act III</h3> <p>Infuriated, the king had ordered Descartes to be arrested and imprisoned. Saddened by the news, Princess Christina took the courage to rescue her lover from prison despite Descartes’ wish to not burden and implicate the princess, so that they could elope to England. Yet in the end, all efforts were to no avail. The king ultimately exiled Descartes to his home country, thereby separating the love ties between Descartes and the princess. Prior to his departure, Descartes gave the princess one final lesson, holding back his tears as he taught Princess Christina what he perceives to be the most beautiful analytical expression there is.</p> <h3 id="act-iv">Act IV</h3> <p>Descartes was able to safely return back to Paris after a new king had ascended to rule over the Kingdom of France, who graciously granted amnesty to fugitives. Unfortunately, Descartes had shortly fallen ill due to the presence of the Black Death that was plaguing Europe. Notwithstanding his struggle against his illness, Descartes would constantly dream about Princess Christina, as she was the only reason for his desire to keep on living besides pursuing mathematics. And thus, out of affection, Descartes wrote letters to the princess from time to time in spite of not having received any replies, and it was only a matter of time before death meets Descartes at the door. Yet unbeknown to Descartes, all of his letters to the princess had been intercepted by the king upon arriving to Stockholm. In his last moments, Descartes wrote one final letter to the princess, marking it to be the 13th letter. After resting his pen and dwelling in the thought of being with Princess Christina, Descartes breathed his last breath on a cold winter day.</p> <h3 id="act-v">Act V</h3> <p>When Descartes’ 13th letter was intercepted by the king as usual, it only contained a mathematical expression that had perplexed him. After summoning a handful of mathematicians to decipher the meaning of this strange letter, no one was able to solve the expression, and thereafter the king gave the letter to Princess Christina. Recalling Descartes’ last lesson to her, the princess cried her heart out after successfully solving the expression on the letter which read</p> <p>\begin{equation} \ r = a (1 - \sin \theta) <br> \end{equation}</p> <p>On the Cartesian coordinate plane, this expression rendered a perfect heart-shaped curve known as a cardioid, representing Descartes’ wholehearted love toward Princess Christina.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/cardioid.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A cardioid attributed to Descartes' studies on analytic geometry (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cardiod_animation.gif" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Image Source</a>). </div> <h2 id="in-reality">In Reality</h2> <p>Though one disclaimer is that this story to which I just told is not, in fact, historically accurate; and thus it ought to be interpreted as more of a fairy tale in lieu of a recollection of an event in the history of Descartes’ life.</p> <p><em>Note:</em> The thumbnail of this post is a 3D view of high-aperture object rotation in transmission holographic tomography (<a href="https://opg.optica.org/view_article.cfm?pdfKey=6480897d-6866-4017-b8482f5bddd6476b_188512" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Image Source</a>).</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2018-12-22-distill.bib"></d-bibliography><div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=localStorage.getItem("theme"),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"k9chen/k9chen.github.io","data-repo-id":"","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"DIC_kwDOJnPCgc4CWuRs","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Kelvin Chen /ˈkɛlvɪn ˈtʃɛn/.
