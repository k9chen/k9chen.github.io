Our inability to discover extraterrestrial life is thus the principal issue of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323913607000124">Fermi paradox</a>, a question that was inspired by Enrico Fermi in 1950 during a lunch time conversation with his fellow physicist friends. Since then, and even long before Fermi had asked the famous question of “where is everybody,”<d-footnote>Fermi's exact remarks were not clear as it was different across the letters written by his colleagues, which included Edward Teller, Herbert York, and Emil Konopinski when they recalled the conversation.</d-footnote> the Fermi paradox has been scrutinized by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Michael H. Hart, Frank J. Tipler, and along with their respective supporters and critics. At the start, the thought of there being extraterrestrial intelligence beyond the confines of Earth seemed rather bleak. Yet, given our sense of probability and fixation with aliens, our intuition informs us otherwise, as demonstrated through the formulation of the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/drake-equation/introduction/90D48C581EA5B6F83F3641132989C86B">Drake equation</a> by Frank Drake to render a probabilistic estimation of the number of alien civilizations within the Milky Way based on detectable electromagnetic radiations, e.g., radio signals, as denoted by \(N\):</p> <p>\begin{equation} N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(R_*\) is the rate of star formation, \(f_p\) is the fraction of those stars with planets, \(n_e\) is the number of planets with a suitable life environment, \(f_l\) is the fraction of those suitable planets that can bear life, \(f_i\) is the fraction of those life-bearing planets on which intelligent life exists, \(f_c\) is the fraction of those intelligent civilizations that possess the technology for interstellar communication, and \(L\) is the length of time such civilizations can actively maintain their method of communication. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C714F4FD72D50FF029131C6E5AAB1946/S1473550417000052a.pdf/search_for_habitable_planets_with_biosignature_gases_framed_by_a_biosignature_drake_equation.pdf">Seager equation</a> is a variant of the classical Drake equation<d-footnote>A statistical generalization of the classical Drake equation based on the Central Limit Theorem has also been proposed by Claudio Maccone, in which each parameter is transformed into a random variable.</d-footnote> that is based on the detection of biogenic gases in lieu of electromagnetic radiations.</p> <p>Of course, the Drake equation has its own pitfalls in terms of its difficulty in estimating certain parameters (i.e., \(f_i\), \(f_c\), and \(L\)) and relying on heavy numerical assumptions, hence generating either optimistic or pessimistic results; for instance, a group of Oxford scientists claims the probability of us being alone in the universe to be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404">39%–85%</a>. While seemingly discouraging, it is sufficient to provide us with some degree of confidence that there is indeed a likelihood for extraterrestrial contact, regardless of how small \(N\) might turn out to be in the final analysis, especially when taking into account the fact that everything above the scale of our galaxy is ignored in the original mathematical formulation of the model and other Drake-like equations. After all, we can only begin to visualize the bigger picture beyond the cosmological horizon by connecting all the dots there is; we are not meant to exist in solitude.</p> <h2 id="years-of-solitude">Years of Solitude</h2> <p>For decades, various theoretical explanations have been posed to address the Fermi paradox, either denying the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence or offering solutions to explain the non-occurrence of extraterrestrial contacts, most of which have been rather optimistic in supporting the latter. One early theory is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901115">zoo hypothesis</a>, a sociological explanation placed forward by John A. Ball asserting that from the perspective of extraterrestrial intelligence, Earth is akin to a galactic zoo such that unbeknown to us, we are being observed while the aliens purposefully hide themselves from our eyes. One problem that the said hypothesis suffers from, however, is the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/26">monocultural fallacy</a>, where, for the Fermi paradox to be dissolved, a set of rules must be in place to be adhered by every independently evolved extraterrestrial civilization to keep the zoo in a state of non-interference (i.e., “Touching the animals is strictly forbidden.”), albeit this solipsistic synchrony among all extraterrestrial civilizations is quite pragmatically unlikely in the absence a pre-emptive, dominant civilization to play the role of zoo keepers to enforce the rules, notably when there are a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations in existence. It has also been posited that contact would ultimately occur in the event that the animals of the zoo have reached a certain level of technological maturity; this would be conceivable as it is only a matter of time, yet due to the fact that we are hardly a Type I civilization<d-footnote>Earth is presently sitting at roughly Type 0.7 on the Kardashev Scale; assuming an energy consumption rate of 3% per year, it would take roughly 100-200 years for Earth to reach Type I status.</d-footnote> on the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38351-y#:~:text=Humanity%20presently%20stands%20at%20Type,energy%20consumption%20models%20are%20oversimplified.">Kardashev Scale</a>–making us ineligible to join the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328721001105">Galactic Club</a>”. To gauge our Kardashev type \(K\) based on our capacity to consume energy, Carl Sagan proposed the following formula utilizing logarithmic interpolation:</p> <p>\begin{equation} K = \frac{\log_{10}P - 6}{10} \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(P\) is the amount of power that a civilization uses. In application, for a civilization to achieve \(K = 2\) requires an energy of the order of \(10^{26}\) watts, which would be feasible if energy can be harnessed from a large star like the Sun through hypothetical megastructures such as the joint-utilization of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16734.pdf">Dyson spheres</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16734.pdf">Matrioshka brains</a>. Indeed, it would not be a surprise if a highly developed civilization on the Kardashev Scale (i.e., \(K &gt; 3\)) is capable of harnessing dark energy from supermassive black holes and influence the expansion rate of the universe to prevent the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.104004?casa_token=6xCwTvS_VNAAAAAA%3AKLHajLEbTB0Pe0uzTFtDBXRDxEcT5RA592Va1rUBtFd102ZnF2NroS3S6OfAbUn1OEAIJvUFITEdiw">Big Rip</a>; even more so, it is also theoretically possible for such a civilization to manipulate the fabric of space-time at the microdimensional scale.<d-footnote>The extent of inward manipulation (i.e., genes, molecules, quarks) that a civilization is capable of is opposite to the measure employed by the Kardashev Scale; space-time manipulation is the highest level of inward manipulation as defined by John D. Barrow.</d-footnote> Thus, extraterrestrial contact appears to be out of the question as of now.</p> <p>Another hypothesis that aims to resolve the Fermi paradox is an idea crafted from the minds of Robin Hanson, known as the <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html">Great Filter</a>, which is essentially a temporal barrier that impedes the development of life forms at some point along the evolutionary continuum, beginning with the onset of abiogenesis to the establishment of, say, a Type III civilization. The Great Filter may be better described as some kind of a freak accident, such as the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their unicellular ancestors, which unironically took approximately two billions years–a rather rare phenomenon. To our curiosity, it has been speculated as to where the Great Filter lies relative to our present time, as well as how many of such filters there are in the history of life. The Fermi paradox clearly made it seem as though the Great Filter had already passed, reinforcing the Rare Earth hypothesis. If this was not true or perhaps there are additional filters in the impending future that has yet to occur, this would be problematic for humanity because a possible Great Filter in the future could mean planetary destruction following a doomsday scenario, e.g., starving to death from a nuclear winter or getting killed by an army of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/von-neumann-probes-rationale-propulsion-interstellar-transfer-timing/5202679D74645D3707248FE5D5FA0124">von Neumann probes</a><d-footnote>The destruction of an intelligent civilization by von Neumann probes is the central idea behind the berserker hypothesis.</d-footnote> sent from extragalactic space. Either way, the point of the Great Filter is that it is an onerous task to make contact with extraterrestrial life when they cannot evolutionarily develop in a similar manner as us humans or they have already been wiped out from the face of the universe. It has also been speculated that we are presently undergoing an <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-008-9149-y">astrobiological phase transition</a>–a period of disequilibrium succeeding a cataclysmic reset event, e.g., a \(\gamma\)-ray bursts impacting our galaxy, in the astrobiological time scale of the universe, in which the birth of new intelligent life has yet to arrive apart from our own civilization, henceforth making us among the first batch of intelligent life in this presumably dead universe.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/bomb.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An Oppenheimerian vision of world destruction from a nuclear holocaust.

In this hypothesis, a civilization would inevitably approach a singularity in which population and energy demands cause infinite growth in a finite amount of time, effectively leading to an asymptomatic burnout characterized by the collapse of the civilization as productivity and resource consumption scale superlinearly; this growth can be modeled by the following <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0610172104">ODE</a>:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \frac{dG(t)}{dt} = \left(\frac{Y_0}{E}\right)G(t)^\beta - \left(\frac{R}{E}\right)G(t) \end{equation}</p> <p>where \(\frac{dG(t)}{dt}\) represents the rate of civilization growth with respect to time \(t\), with \(Y\) being a measure of the material resources required to sustain the civilization while \(R\) is the resources needed per capita on average, \(E\) is the resources needed, on average, for adding a new individual to the civilization, and \(\beta\) is the superlinear scaling exponent that is reflective of the general socioeconomic dynamics across the civilization, e.g., encroaching upon other worlds. In cases where \(\beta &gt; 1\), a singularity arises as the demand for resources becomes infinite in an uncontrolled population where \(G(t)\) increases in a superlinear fashion at an unprecedented exponential rate, instigating a drastic regression as the energy supply is exhausted. Given the omnipresence of the dataome, the plausibility of this hypothesis is evident in our daily lives in which our experiences are saturated with information due to the interplay among technological agents and globalization, thereby increasing the value of \(\beta\).</p> <p>To mitigate the occurrence of a singularity as a result of superlinear scaling, the parameters of the growth equation must be reset by means of innovations within the civilization to allow for a new growth trajectory; however, if \(\beta &gt; 1\) still holds true, another singularity would occur in a dreaded cycle and eventually, with time, the frequency of growth would increase in conjunction with a decrease in the time scale between innovations until the overall system collapses from an asymptomatic burnout. The point at which such burnouts occur is thus the Great Filter for humanity. Though to prevent a potential collapse necessitates a homeostatic awakening such that the civilization must come to a realization of its imminent fate prior to collapsing. In some cases, the time that is needed for such realizations to be made may precede the time of the burnout, resulting in a positive time window that can facilitate the civilization to implement systematic changes that would alter the course of its internal dynamics to favor homeostasis, such as abandoning the desire for cosmic colonialism and supremacy to reduce energy demands. Regardless of the outcomes, it is within the interest of the civilization in question to remain silent; as the proverb goes, silence is golden. Therefore, detecting extraterrestrial intelligence only becomes increasingly challenging from a remote distance, like playing hide-and-seek in a dark room, except the room is as far and wide as the universe.</p> <blockquote> <p>“I’m sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It’s just been too intelligent to come here.” ― Arthur C. Clarke</p> </blockquote> <p>Alternatively, if the search for aliens is akin to a simple game of hide-and-seek, should we consider the possibility of the aliens escaping the room to cheat the game while leaving us behind in the dark? The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576511003304">transcension hypothesis</a> thinks along this line of reasoning, arguing that advanced civilizations had transcended into a computationally optimal, black hole-like “inner space” that is outside of our universe. Black holes are an ideal descriptor to illustrate such “inner spaces” due to their potential for, among many things, computing, harvesting energy, and creating a new universe–all of which are attractions that sufficiently intelligent civilizations would aspire to attain, thus compelling them to accept transcension as a developmental destiny as believed by John M. Smart. Civilizations that fail to develop into the stage of transcension thus reside in the “outer space” unless they can somehow overcome this filter; in this regard, it appears that we are far from transcension if this hypothesis was true.</p> <h2 id="a-dark-forest">A Dark Forest</h2> <p>The archive of possible solutions in response to the Fermi paradox is extremely extensive in terms of the existing literature, and it is not within my intention to discuss them all thoroughly herein. Though one particular solution that is of interest is provided by David Brin, wherein a civilization would annihilate another civilization to acquire the latter’s resources for its own territorial expansion in accordance with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580907000676?via%3Dihub">Darwinian fitness</a>, provided that it has the technological means to do so. In the Drake equation, parameters such as \(f_i\) would thus decrease in value under such circumstances. In a universe where the amount of resources is finite, such predator-prey relations are bound to happen, and naturally, any civilization harboring the fear of annihilation by another civilization with a predatory nature would choose to make its existence unknowable, and this key notion serves as the crux of the dark forest hypothesis–alluding to the sci-fi trilogy <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> written by Liu Cixin, featuring a technologically vastly superior alien civilization called Trisolarans and their contact with Earth by means of interstellar invasion, where Earth is at risk of total annihilation by the hostile Trisolaran race after intercepting Earth’s broadcasted radio signals. As Liu elegantly explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life–another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod–there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, the dark forest hypothesis does not portray the universe as a fun playground unlike some of the more optimistic interpretations to the Fermi paradox. It is therefore unwise for civilizations (like us) to broadcast signals out into space to advertise their exact location, especially taking into account the fact that our civilization cannot create something as advanced and ingenious as quantum-entangled, proton-sized sentient supercomputers with light-speed capabilities<d-footnote>In the series, these are known as sophons made from the unfolding of 11-dimensional protons into 2-dimensional sheets with a strong interaction-induced etched circuitry, after which the proton sheet is folded back into its 11-dimensional form.</d-footnote> for espionage purposes as the Trisolarans did; this idea of the universe as a dark forest shares the same motivation as the aforementioned hypotheses about remaining silent to promote survival, which could suggest the existence of a plethora of extraterrestrial civilizations and explain the lack of detectable signals from space.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/forest.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The universe as a figurative dark forest.

The ethics of doings so has been heavily debated, with Stephen Hawking who once made the comparison of aliens contacting Earth to Christopher Columbus arriving at the Americas. Of course, the latter ended with a history of enslavement, bloody massacres, and viral diseases for the Native Americans. The ramifications of extraterrestrial contact can thus be easily imagined; after all, it would be a foolish idea to shout into the dark forest as if we are asking for our own demise.</p> <h2 id="bayesian-games">Bayesian Games</h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B0080430767006057">game theory</a>, the dark forest hypothesis and the behavior of alien civilizations can be modeled via a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2297414?seq=1">sequential game with incomplete information</a>. Let us first suppose a game involving civilizations A and B (henceforth referred to as \(C_A\) and \(C_B\), respectively) as the players, such that they are both aware of each other’s existence and are technologically capable of destroying one another; this is a scenario in which both civilizations are given complete information about each other and the game is played in its <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-69291-1_14#:~:text=A%20game%20in%20extensive%20form,and%20also%20occur%20in%20Chaps.">extensive form</a>. Prior to the game, two axioms are established as follows which are directly derived from Liu’s conceptualization of the dark forest:</p> <ol> <li>Survival is the primary need of civilization.</li> <li>Civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in the universe remains constant.</li> </ol> <p>\(C_A\) begins the game where it can choose to either (i) destroy the other civilization or (ii) do nothing. In the case of (i), this results in a positive payoff for \(C_A\) but a negative payoff for \(C_B\); in contrast, a zero payoff is resulted in the case of (ii). If (ii) turns out to be the chosen case, it follows that \(C_B\) now has the opportunity to destroy \(C_A\) by choosing (i); otherwise, the game would continue infinitely if \(C_B\) were to choose (ii) until one of the them is destroyed by the other. By backward induction, it is thus clear that the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1020945525108.pdf">subgame perfect Nash equilibrium</a> would be to have \(C_A\) destroy \(C_B\) at the first very round to prevent \(C_B\) from have a turn to destroy \(C_A\).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/trees.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A decision tree illustrating the respective payoffs for both civilizations in a sequential game with complete information under non-Bayesian conditions. </div> <p>Now let us consider a slightly different extensive-form game that takes place in a Bayesian setting, in which both civilizations are unaware of each other’s existence and are thus provided with incomplete information to evaluate their respective payoffs which are no longer common knowledge. \(C_A\) begins the game where three choices are available: (i) destroy the other civilization (provided that their existence is known), (ii) broadcast a signal to reveal its existence, or (iii) stay silent. The only viable options for \(C_A\) are either (ii) or (iii) since it does not know the existence of \(C_B\) yet; choosing the former could put \(C_A\) at risk of being destroyed by \(C_B\), whereas the latter would guarantee \(C_A\)’s survival. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002205319190155W#:~:text=Perfect%20Bayesian%20equilibrium%20and%20sequential%20equilibrium%E2%98%86&amp;text=PBE%20is%20equivalent%20to%20sequential,types%20with%20posterior%20probability%20zero.">perfect Bayesian equilibrium</a> would thus be for \(C_A\) to choose (iii) to avoid the potential outcome of being destroyed by \(C_B\). Logically, the dominant strategy to deploy in both scenarios is to follow the above axioms of the dark forest hypothesis, that is, to destroy other civilizations if practical while staying silent in regard to our whereabouts, which would ultimately lead to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16170-4_7">Pareto-efficient</a> outcome for the winning civilization.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/decitreetwo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A decision tree illustrating the respective payoffs for both civilizations in a sequential game with incomplete information under Bayesian conditions. </div> <h2 id="alien-morality">Alien Morality</h2> <p>Suppose we are aware of the existence of an exoplanet that is more than a hundred light-years away and is inhabited by aliens that are benevolent in nature, whom are also aware of our existence; this special scenario then begs the question, would it still be justifiable to destroy the said civilization according to the dark forest hypothesis? Morally speaking, doing so would be no different than murdering your friendly neighbor. The problem with this scenario is that we have no means of knowing whether the civilization in question is benevolent or malevolent due to constraints in interstellar communication. Our inability to ascertain the true intentions of a foreign civilization can be satirically depicted as follows: Say that country X “accidentally” dropped a nuclear bomb on country Y; subsequently, the president of country Y thinks of this as a declaration of war from country X. To resolve the apparent misunderstanding, the president of country X can simply make a phone call to the president of country Y explaining how it was purely an accident, thus preventing a potential breakout of war. This would not be feasible if country Y is located on a planet that is hundreds of light-years away. A worst-case scenario would be to spend the time to gather information about the civilization of interest, only to discover that they are malevolent and are already making the first move to destroy us; with this in mind, the safest option to ensure our survival would be to destroy the said civilization notwithstanding–thereby eliminating a potential threat–before they get a chance. After all, it is plausible for them to apply the same logic to us in the event that they suspect we are a malevolent civilization; even if they were to assume we are indeed benevolent, they would nevertheless consider the possibility of us suspecting them as malevolent, which would give them a sufficient reason to destroy us to ensure their survival. To break this “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48638053">chain of suspicion</a>” between any two civilizations (or among multiple civilizations), the dark forest hypothesis claims that, following natural selection, only one civilization will prevail should a sound be heard in the universe.</p> <p>While we may know nothing about the moral behavior of extraterrestrial intelligence, it does not hurt to formulate some bold ideas about their nature using our own civilization as a reference. To this date, it would be an overstatement to say our civilization is at peace given our past history and the ongoing international and domestic tensions that are due to our intolerance of others’ race, gender, politics, religion, class, etc., which are causes that would, in theory, escalate into the self-destruction of mankind as technology continues to rapidly progress while our moral compass remains stagnant in the long-run. For an extraterrestrial civilization with an even greater technological capability than us, the fact that they have yet to self-destruct implies that they must have learned to co-exist with one another peacefully in their evolutionary trajectory, such that their sense of morality is of similar magnitude as their technological development. As a matter of fact, a civilization’s societal progress toward peace ought to be assessed on the grounds of their collective moral development in lieu of their level of science and technology since peace can be attained in various ways, some of which are rather unethical. For example, peace can be established in a civilization that is under a 1984-inspired totalitarian regime in which the subjects are controlled by the ruling dictator through mind-controlling technology. Thus, a civilization that is effectively experiencing a moral stagnancy or decline is invariably prone to self-destruction, whereas a highly developed civilization is likely to continue to exist for prolonged periods of time (unless they are destroyed by external factors) as they are guided by strong moral principles.<d-footnote>One other possibility is for a civilization to have a high level of moral development but a low level of technological development; of course, such civilizations would not be vulnerable to self-destruction.</d-footnote> The latter proposition is quite reassuring for us if aliens were to ever visit Earth, in which case they are unlikely to pose as a threat as opposed to the Trisolarans, and albeit this argument is made on the basis of probability and is not self-evident in the least, it offers one possible objection to the dark forest hypothesis so as to make the desolate universe appear more tolerable and humane.</p> <blockquote> <p>“There are many ways to say I love you in this cold, dark, silent universe, as many as the twinkling stars.” ― Ken Liu</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps our desperate search for intelligent life in the universe may serve as a humble reminder to urge ourselves to love one another and cherish our differences for the betterment of humanity down the road. Whether or not we are alone in this vast universe, all that we need to know is the simple fact that our continual existence is a testament to our curiosity and perseverance as we mark our footprints in the history of the universe.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/sky.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The starry night sky is ever so silent yet enchanting.
