Originally from Fujian, China, I am a second-year at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in bioethics. Presently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/) working on projects related to iPSC-induced 3D brain organoid models and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, advised by [Dr. Lulu Jiang](https://med.virginia.edu/neuroscience/faculty/primary-faculty/lulu-jiang-md-phd/) at the [Center for Brain Immunology and Glia](https://med.virginia.edu/big/).

My research focuses on translating the neuropathological mechanisms and biomarkers of nervous system disorders into novelly refined diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications. Of secondary relevance to my research is analyzing the neuroethical implications of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality care and conducting clinical trials.

My recreational interests include, inter alia, drinking caffeine, watching political satire, reading sci-fi and magical realism, and theorizing about extraterrestrial intelligence.

## Quotes
* "How can a three-pound mass of jelly that you can hold in your palm imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos? [...] This, truly, it the greatest mystery of all." ― V.S. Ramachandran
* "It is strange to see how the populace, which nourishes its imagination with tales of witches or saints, mysterious events and extraordinary occurrences, disdains the world around it as commonplace, monotonous and prosaic, without suspecting that at bottom it is all secret, mystery and marvel." ― Santiago Ramón y Cajal
* "The body does whatever it wants. I am not my body; I am my mind." ― Rita Levi-Montalcini
