<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a third-year at the <a href='https://www.virginia.edu/'>University of Virginia</a> pursuing a double major in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. Presently, I am advised by Dr. <a href='https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788'>Petr Tvrdik</a> in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at <a href='https://med.virginia.edu/'>UVA School of Medicine</a>, where I conduct research on microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My research focuses on translating neuropathological biomarkers and mechanisms of neurovascular diseases (e.g., stroke, neuropathy, cavernoma) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications via integrating computational and experimental methods.</p>
