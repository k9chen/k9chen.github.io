Originally from Fujian, China, I am an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia pursuing a double major in neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in bioethics. Presently, I am a neuroimaging research intern at the [Barrow Neurological Institute]() advised by [Dr. Richard Dortch]().

My research focuses on translating the neuropathological mechanisms and biomarkers of nervous system disorders into novelly refined diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications.

Of relevance to my research is analyzing the neuroethical implications of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality care and conducting clinical trials. I also engage in my non-academic interests which includes, inter alia, drinking caffeine, watching political satire, and finding the One Piece.
