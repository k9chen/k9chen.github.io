Hello! I am a second-year B.A. candidate at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in bioethics. Presently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/) working on projects that aim to understand 1) protein-protein/RNA interactions in Alzheimer's disease and 2) cortical microglial dynamics in ischemic stroke, advised by Drs. [Lulu Jiang](https://med.virginia.edu/neuroscience/faculty/primary-faculty/lulu-jiang-md-phd/) and [Petr Tvrdik](https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/pt8bm/) in the Departments of Neuroscience and Neurosurgery, respectively.

My research focuses on translating the neuropathological mechanisms of [nervous system disorders](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications. Of secondary interest to my research is analyzing the [neuroethics](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-neuroethics#:~:text=Neuroethics%20is%20a%20field%20that,identity%2C%20consciousness%2C%20and%20autonomy.) of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality care and conducting clinical trials.

I have a not-so-peculiar affection for midnight snacks, political satire, and the literary works of, inter alios, Ken Liu, Ted Chiang, and Keigo Higashino.

## Quotes
* "How can a three-pound mass of jelly that you can hold in your palm imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos? [...] This, truly, it the greatest mystery of all." ― V.S. Ramachandran
* "It is strange to see how the populace, which nourishes its imagination with tales of witches or saints, mysterious events and extraordinary occurrences, disdains the world around it as commonplace, monotonous and prosaic, without suspecting that at bottom it is all secret, mystery and marvel." ― Santiago Ramón y Cajal
* "The body does whatever it wants. I am not my body; I am my mind." ― Rita Levi-Montalcini
