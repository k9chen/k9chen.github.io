I am a third-year at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. I am advised by Dr. [Petr Tvrdik](https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788) in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/), where I conduct research in microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models. Presently, I am a research intern in the Division of Neuroimaging Research at [Barrow Neurological Institute](https://www.barrowneuro.org/) working on developing a dMRI-based computational framework for improving the pathological specificity of nerve re/degeneration in peripheral neuropathy, advised by Dr. [Richard Dortch](https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/richard-dortch-phd/).

My primary research focuses on translating neuropathological biomarkers and mechanisms of [nervous system disorders](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications through integrating computational and experimental methods. Of secondary interest to my research is analyzing the [neuroethical implications](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-neuroethics#:~:text=Neuroethics%20is%20a%20field%20that,identity%2C%20consciousness%2C%20and%20autonomy.) of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality health care and running clinical trials to inform human understanding, ethics, and policy in research and development.

The following info is not needed, but is included for signaling purposes: I have a special affection for sci-fi novels, political satire, deadpan humor, sundubu-jjigae, and the [Dinosaur Game](chrome://dino/), albeit I have a fervid disdain towards, inter alia, Celsius energy drinks. In case anyone is interested, my NeuroTree is viewable [here](http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=936347&pnodecount=4&cnodecount=2&fontsize=1).
