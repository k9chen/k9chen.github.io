**BIO:** I am a third-year at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in bioethics. I am advised by Dr. [Petr Tvrdik](https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788) in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at the [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/), where I research microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models. Presently, I am a research intern at Barrow Neurological Institute in the Division of Neuroimaging Research, advised by Dr. [Richard Dortch](https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/richard-dortch-phd/).

My research focuses on translating the neuropathological mechanisms of [nervous system disorders](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications. Of secondary interest to my research is analyzing the [neuroethics](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-neuroethics#:~:text=Neuroethics%20is%20a%20field%20that,identity%2C%20consciousness%2C%20and%20autonomy.) of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality care and conducting clinical trials.

I have a special affection for sci-fi novels, political satire, and sundubu-jjigae. In case anyone is interested, my [NeuroTree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3465338/) is viewable <u>[here](http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=936347&pnodecount=4&cnodecount=2&fontsize=1)</u>.

## Quotes
* "How can a three-pound mass of jelly that you can hold in your palm imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos? [...] This, truly, it the greatest mystery of all." ― V. S. Ramachandran
* "It is strange to see how the populace, which nourishes its imagination with tales of witches or saints, mysterious events and extraordinary occurrences, disdains the world around it as commonplace, monotonous and prosaic, without suspecting that at bottom it is all secret, mystery and marvel." ― Santiago Ramón y Cajal
* "The body does whatever it wants. I am not my body; I am my mind." ― Rita Levi-Montalcini
