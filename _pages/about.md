I am a third-year at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. Presently, I am advised by Dr. [Petr Tvrdik](https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788) in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/), where I conduct research in microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models.

My research focuses on translating neuropathological biomarkers and mechanisms of neurovascular diseases (e.g., stroke, neuropathy, cavernoma) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications through integrating computational and experimental methods.

For any inquiries, please direct emails to: ddw4hp [at] virginia [dot] edu
