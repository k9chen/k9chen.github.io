I am a third-year at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) pursuing a double major in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. I am advised by Dr. [Petr Tvrdik](https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788) in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at [UVA School of Medicine](https://med.virginia.edu/), where I research microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models. Presently, I am a research intern at the [Barrow Neuroimaging Innovation Center](https://www.barrowneuro.org/for-physicians-researchers/research/research-programs-labs/neuroimaging/imaging-center/), advised by Dr. [Richard Dortch](https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/richard-dortch-phd/).

My research focuses on translating the neuropathological mechanisms of [nervous system disorders](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders) into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications. Of secondary interest to my research is analyzing the [neuroethics](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-neuroethics#:~:text=Neuroethics%20is%20a%20field%20that,identity%2C%20consciousness%2C%20and%20autonomy.) of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality care and conducting clinical trials.

The following info is not needed, but is included for signaling purposes: I have a special affection for sci-fi novels, political satire, and sundubu-jjigae. In case anyone is interested, my [NeuroTree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3465338/) is viewable [here](http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=936347&pnodecount=4&cnodecount=2&fontsize=1).
