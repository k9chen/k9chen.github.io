<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a third-year undergraduate at <a href='https://www.virginia.edu/'>UVA</a> majoring in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. I am respectively advised by Drs. <a href='https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&id=48788'>Petr Tvrdik</a> and <a href='https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/richard-dortch-phd/'>Richard Dortch</a> in the Departments of Neurosurgery and Translational Neuroscience at <a href='https://med.virginia.edu/'>UVA School of Medicine</a> and <a href='https://www.barrowneuro.org/'>Barrow Neurological Institute</a>, where I conduct neurologic disease-oriented preclinical research.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main research focuses on translating pathophysiological biomarkers and mechanisms of neurovascular diseases into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications via the integration of computational and experimental methods.</p>

Here are some current research projects that I am working on:

<br><br>

<b><i>1.</i></b> Mapping phenotypic and spatial heterogeneity of myeloid cell subtypes in the recombinase-mediated <i>RC::RLTG</i> reporter mouse following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.

<p style="margin-top: 7px;"><b>Collaborator(s) @ UVA SOM:</b> Khadijeh Sharifi, Ph.D., Petr Tvrdik, Ph.D.</p>



<b><i>2.</i></b> Developing a Rician distributed multi-compartmental DWI-MRI signal simulation via Monte Carlo to assay pathologically realistic tissue microstructure in trauma-induced peripheral nerves.

<p style="margin-top: 7px;"><b>Collaborator(s) @ Barrow:</b> Thammathida Ketsiri, Ph.D., Richard Dortch, Ph.D.</p>



<b><i>3.</i></b> Training U-Net-based ML models for biomedical image segmentation of spinal pathology.
