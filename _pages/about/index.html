<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a third-year at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a> pursuing a double major in neuroscience and chemistry with a minor in bioethics. I am advised by Dr. <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/bims/faculty/?facbio=1&amp;id=48788" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Petr Tvrdik</a> in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience at <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UVA School of Medicine</a>, where I conduct research in microglial dynamics following focal cerebral ischemia in mouse models. Presently, I am a research intern in the Division of Neuroimaging Research at <a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Barrow Neurological Institute</a> working on developing a dMRI-based computational framework for improving the pathological specificity of nerve re/degeneration in peripheral neuropathy, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/richard-dortch-phd/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Richard Dortch</a>.</p> <p>My primary research focuses on translating neuropathological biomarkers and mechanisms of <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nervous system disorders</a> into novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical applications through integrating computational and experimental methods. Of secondary interest to my research is analyzing the <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/focus-tools-topics/focus-neuroethics#:~:text=Neuroethics%20is%20a%20field%20that,identity%2C%20consciousness%2C%20and%20autonomy." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">neuroethical implications</a> of brain intervention technologies on patient wellbeing in the context of delivering quality health care and running clinical trials to inform human understanding, ethics, and policy in research and development.</p> <p>The following info is not needed, but is included for signaling purposes: I have a special affection for sci-fi novels, political satire, deadpan humor, sundubu-jjigae, and the <a href="chrome://dino/">Dinosaur Game</a>, albeit I have a fervid disdain towards, inter alia, Celsius energy drinks.
