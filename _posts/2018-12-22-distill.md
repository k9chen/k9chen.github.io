## A Dot in the Universe

All of us are tiny specks of stardust floating amid a dark void of space; our universe is much like a grand pointillist painting comprised of a multitude of colorful, ubiquitous dots in the form of stars, planets, nebulae, asteroids, and other astronomical objects. The conservative belief that Earth is the only (unique) place in the universe to contain intelligent life with technological capabilities--the [Rare Earth hypothesis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/66BF2364A85A6EE6FB4E8CE617899711/S1473550410000030a.pdf/div-class-title-numerical-testing-of-the-rare-earth-hypothesis-using-monte-carlo-realization-techniques-div.pdf)--is quite absurd, albeit the apparent limited empirical evidence to refute this claim ought to be acknowledged as we are currently governed by the physical, temporal, and sociological constraints of the [Great Silence](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983QJRAS..24..283B). Nevertheless, it is only a natural proclivity for our curious minds to ponder upon what is out there and to comprehend the incomprehensible as it outweighs our fear of the unknown, even if our efforts were to no avail. To us, this is simply a game of hide-and-seek.

Considering the current progress of spacefaring technology and the work done by organizations such as [SETI](https://www.seti.org/), the likelihood of making extraterrestrial contact with aliens does not appear to be as easy as those portrayed in sci-fi stories. Our inability to discover extraterrestrial life is thus the central issue of the [Fermi paradox](https://www.seti.org/fermi-paradox-0). Yet our intuition informs us otherwise given our sense of probability, as demonstrated through the formulation of the [Drake equation](https://www.seti.org/drake-equation-index) to render a probabilistic estimation of the number of alien civilizations within the Milky Way based on detectable electromagnetic radiations, as denoted by $$ N $$

$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
$$

where $$ R_* $$ is the rate of star formation, $$ f_p $$ is the fraction of those stars with planets, $$ n_e $$ is the number of planets with a suitable life environment, $$ f_l $$ is the fraction of those suitable planets that can bear life, $$ f_i $$ is the fraction of those life-bearing planets on which intelligent life exists, $$ f_c $$ is the fraction of those intelligent civilizations that possess the technology for interstellar communication, and $$ L $$ is the length of time such civilizations can actively maintain their method of communication. Furthermore, the [Seager equation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C714F4FD72D50FF029131C6E5AAB1946/S1473550417000052a.pdf/search_for_habitable_planets_with_biosignature_gases_framed_by_a_biosignature_drake_equation.pdf) is a variant of the classical Drake equation<d-footnote>There is also a statistical generalization of the Drake equation based on the Central Limit Theorem in which each parameter is transformed into a random variable.</d-footnote> that is based on the detection of biogenic gases in lieu of electromagnetic radiations.

Of course, the Drake equation has its own pitfalls in terms of its difficulty in estimating certain parameters (i.e., $$ f_i $$, $$ f_c $$, and $$ L $$) and relying on heavy numerical assumptions, hence generating either optimistic or pessimistic results; for instance, a group of Oxford scientists claims the probability of us being alone in the universe to be [39%-85%](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404). While seemingly discouraging, it is sufficient to provide us with some degree of confidence that there is indeed a likelihood for extraterrestrial contact, regardless of how small $$ N $$ might turn out to be in the final analysis, especially when taking into account the fact that everything above the scale of our galaxy is ignored in the original mathematical formulation of the model and other Drake-like equations. After all, we can only begin to visualize the bigger picture beyond the cosmological horizon by connecting all the dots there is; we are not meant to exist in solitude.

## Plausible Solutions

For decades, various theoretical explanations have been posed to address the Fermi paradox, either denying the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence or offering solutions to explain the non-occurrence of extraterrestrial contacts, most of which have been rather optimistic in supporting the latter. One early theory is the [zoo hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901115), a sociological explanation asserting that from the perspective of extraterrestrial intelligence, Earth is akin to a galactic zoo such that unbeknown to us, we are being observed while the aliens purposefully hide themselves from our eyes. One problem that the said hypothesis suffers from, however, is the [monocultural fallacy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/26), where, for the Fermi paradox to be dissolved, a set of rules must be in place to be adhered by every independently evolved extraterrestrial civilization to keep the zoo in a state of non-interference, albeit this solipsistic synchrony among all extraterrestrial civilizations is quite pragmatically unlikely in the absence a pre-emptive, dominant civilization to play the role of zoo keepers to enforce the rules. It has also been posited that contact would ultimately occur in the event that the animals of the zoo have reached a certain level of technological maturity; this would be conceivable as it is only a matter of time, yet due to the fact that we are hardly a Type I civilization on the [Kardashev Scale](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38351-y#:~:text=Humanity%20presently%20stands%20at%20Type,energy%20consumption%20models%20are%20oversimplified.)<d-footnote>Earth is presently sitting at roughly Type 0.7 on the Kardashev Scale.<d-footnote>, we are unable to join the '[Galactic Club](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328721001105). Indeed, it would not be a surprise if a highly developed civilization on the Kardashev Scale are capable of harnessing dark energy from black holes. Thus, extraterrestrial contact appears to be out of the question as of now.

Another hypothesis that aims to resolve the Fermi paradox is an idea known as the [Great Filter](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html), which is essentially a temporal barrier that impedes the development of life forms at some point along the evolutionary continuum, beginning with the onset of abiogenesis to the establishment of, say, a Type III civilization. The Great Filter may be better described as some kind of a freak accident, such as the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their unicellular ancestors, which unironically took approximately two billions years, a rather rare phenomenon. To our curiosity, it has been speculated as to where the Great Filter lies relative to our present time, as well as how many of such filters there are in the history of life. The Fermi paradox clearly made it seem as though the Great Filter had already passed, reinforcing the Rare Earth hypothesis. If this was not true or perhaps there are additional filters in the impending future that has yet to occur, this would be problematic for humanity because a possible Great Filter in the future could mean planetary destruction following a doomsday scenario, e.g., a gamma-ray burst hitting Earth or getting killed by [Von Neumann probes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/von-neumann-probes-rationale-propulsion-interstellar-transfer-timing/5202679D74645D3707248FE5D5FA0124). Either way, the point of the Great Filter is that it is an onerous task to make contact with extraterrestrial life when they cannot evolutionarily develop in a similar manner as us humans or they have already been wiped out from the face of the universe.   

One other solution that is loosely related to the Great Filter is explained by [superlinear scaling](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0029).

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
