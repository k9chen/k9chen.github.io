## A Dot in the Universe

All of us are tiny specks of stardust floating amid a dark void of space; our universe is much like a grand pointillist painting comprised of a multitude of colorful, ubiquitous dots in the form of stars, planets, nebulae, asteroids, and other astronomical objects. The conservative belief that Earth is the only (unique) place in the universe to contain intelligent life with technological capabilities--the [Rare Earth hypothesis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/66BF2364A85A6EE6FB4E8CE617899711/S1473550410000030a.pdf/div-class-title-numerical-testing-of-the-rare-earth-hypothesis-using-monte-carlo-realization-techniques-div.pdf)--is quite absurd, albeit the apparent limited empirical evidence to refute this claim ought to be acknowledged as we are currently governed by the physical, temporal, and sociological constraints of the [Great Silence](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983QJRAS..24..283B). Nevertheless, it is only a natural proclivity for our curious minds to ponder upon what is out there and to comprehend the incomprehensible as it outweighs our fear of the unknown, even if our efforts were to no avail.

Considering the current progress of spacefaring technology and the work done by organizations such as [SETI](https://www.seti.org/), the possibility of making extraterrestrial contact with aliens does not appear to be as easy as those portrayed in typical sci-fi stories about extraterrestrial intelligence, e.g., Carl Sagan's novel *Contact*. Our inability to discover extraterrestrial life is thus the central issue of the [Fermi paradox](https://www.seti.org/fermi-paradox-0), a question that has been scrutinized by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Michael Hart, David Viewing, and others alike along with their respective dissenters. Yet our intuition informs us otherwise given our sense of probability, as demonstrated through the formulation of the [Drake equation](https://www.seti.org/drake-equation-index) to render a probabilistic estimation of the number of alien civilizations within the Milky Way based on detectable EM radiations, as denoted by $$ N $$:

$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L,
$$

where $$ R_* $$ is the rate of star formation, $$ f_p $$ is the fraction of those stars with planets, $$ n_e $$ is the number of planets with a suitable life environment, $$ f_l $$ is the fraction of those suitable planets that can bear life, $$ f_i $$ is the fraction of those life-bearing planets on which intelligent life exists, $$ f_c $$ is the fraction of those intelligent civilizations that possess the technology for interstellar communication, and $$ L $$ is the length of time such civilizations can actively maintain their method of communication. Furthermore, the [Seager equation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C714F4FD72D50FF029131C6E5AAB1946/S1473550417000052a.pdf/search_for_habitable_planets_with_biosignature_gases_framed_by_a_biosignature_drake_equation.pdf) is a variant of the classical Drake equation<d-footnote>There is also a statistical generalization of the Drake equation based on the Central Limit Theorem in which each parameter is transformed into a random variable.</d-footnote> that is based on the detection of biogenic gases in lieu of EM radiations.

Of course, the Drake equation has its own pitfalls in terms of its difficulty in estimating certain parameters (i.e., $$ f_i $$, $$ f_c $$, and $$ L $$) and relying on heavy numerical assumptions, hence generating either optimistic or pessimistic results; for instance, a group of Oxford scientists claims the probability of us being alone in the universe to be [39%â€“85%](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404). While seemingly discouraging, it is sufficient to provide us with some degree of confidence that there is indeed a likelihood for extraterrestrial contact, regardless of how small $$ N $$ might turn out to be in the final analysis, especially when taking into account the fact that everything above the scale of our galaxy is ignored in the original mathematical formulation of the model and other Drake-like equations. After all, we can only begin to visualize the bigger picture beyond the cosmological horizon by connecting all the dots there is; we are not meant to exist in solitude.

## Solitude Explained

For decades, various theoretical explanations have been posed to address the Fermi paradox, either denying the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence or offering solutions to explain the non-occurrence of extraterrestrial contacts, most of which have been rather optimistic in supporting the latter. One early theory is the [zoo hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901115), a sociological explanation placed forward by John Ball asserting that from the perspective of extraterrestrial intelligence, Earth is akin to a galactic zoo such that unbeknown to us, we are being observed while the aliens purposefully hide themselves from our eyes. One problem that the said hypothesis suffers from, however, is the [monocultural fallacy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/26), where, for the Fermi paradox to be dissolved, a set of rules must be in place to be adhered by every independently evolved extraterrestrial civilization to keep the zoo in a state of non-interference, albeit this solipsistic synchrony among all extraterrestrial civilizations is quite pragmatically unlikely in the absence a pre-emptive, dominant civilization to play the role of zoo keepers to enforce the rules. It has also been posited that contact would ultimately occur in the event that the animals of the zoo have reached a certain level of technological maturity; this would be conceivable as it is only a matter of time, yet due to the fact that we are hardly a Type I civilization<d-footnote>Earth is presently sitting at roughly Type 0.7 on the Kardashev Scale.</d-footnote> on the [Kardashev Scale](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38351-y#:~:text=Humanity%20presently%20stands%20at%20Type,energy%20consumption%20models%20are%20oversimplified.), we are unable to join the '[Galactic Club](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328721001105). Indeed, it would not be a surprise if a highly developed civilization on the Kardashev Scale are capable of harnessing dark energy from black holes. Thus, extraterrestrial contact appears to be out of the question as of now as we undergo an [astrobiological phase transition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-008-9149-y).

Another hypothesis that aims to resolve the Fermi paradox is an idea crafted from the minds of Robin Hanson, known as the [Great Filter](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html), which is essentially a temporal barrier that impedes the development of life forms at some point along the evolutionary continuum, beginning with the onset of abiogenesis to the establishment of, say, a Type III civilization. The Great Filter may be better described as some kind of a freak accident, such as the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their unicellular ancestors, which unironically took approximately two billions years, a rather rare phenomenon. To our curiosity, it has been speculated as to where the Great Filter lies relative to our present time, as well as how many of such filters there are in the history of life. The Fermi paradox clearly made it seem as though the Great Filter had already passed, reinforcing the Rare Earth hypothesis. If this was not true or perhaps there are additional filters in the impending future that has yet to occur, this would be problematic for humanity because a possible Great Filter in the future could mean planetary destruction following a doomsday scenario, e.g., starving to death from nuclear winters, a $$ \gamma $$-ray burst hitting Earth, or getting killed by [von Neumann probes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/von-neumann-probes-rationale-propulsion-interstellar-transfer-timing/5202679D74645D3707248FE5D5FA0124) sent from extragalactic space. Either way, the point of the Great Filter is that it is an onerous task to make contact with extraterrestrial life when they cannot evolutionarily develop in a similar manner as us humans or they have already been wiped out from the face of the universe.   

One other solution that is closely related to the Great Filter is explained by [superlinear scaling](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0029). In this hypothesis, a civilization would inevitably approach a singularity in which population and energy demands cause infinite growth in a finite amount of time, effectively leading to an asymptomatic burnout characterized by the collapse of the civilization as productivity and resource consumption scale superlinearly; this growth can be modeled by the following [ODE](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0610172104):

$$
\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = \left(\frac{Y_0}{E}\right)N(t)^\beta - \left(\frac{R}{E}\right)N(t),
$$

where $$ \frac{dG(t)}{dt} $$ represents the rate of civilization growth with respect to time $$ t $$, with $$ Y $$ being a measure of the material resources required to sustain the civilization while $$ R $$ is the resources needed per capita on average, $$ E $$ is the resources needed, on average, for adding a new individual to the civilization, and $$ \beta $$ is the superlinear scaling exponent that is reflective of the general socioeconomic dynamics across the civilization, e.g., encroaching upon other worlds. In cases where $$ \beta > 1 $$, a singularity arises as the demand for resources becomes infinite in an uncontrolled population where $$ G $$ increases in a superlinear fashion, instigating a drastic regression as the energy supply is exhausted. Given the omnipresence of the dataome, the plausibility of this hypothesis is evident in our daily lives in which our experiences are saturated with information due to the interplay among technological agents and globalization, thereby increasing the value of $$ \beta $$.

To mitigate the occurrence of a singularity as a result of superlinear scaling, the parameters of the growth equation must be reset by means of innovations within the civilization to allow for a new growth trajectory; however, if $$ \beta > 1 $$ still holds true, another singularity would occur in a dreaded cycle and eventually, with time, the frequency of growth would increase in conjunction with a decrease in the time scale between innovations until the overall system collapses from an asymptomatic burnout. The point at which such burnouts occur is thus the Great Filter for humanity. Though to prevent a potential collapse necessitates a homeostatic awakening such that the civilization must come to a realization of its imminent fate prior to collapsing. In some cases, the time that is needed for such realizations to be made may precede the time of the burnout, resulting in a positive time window that can facilitate the civilization to implement systematic changes that would alter the course of its internal dynamics to favor homeostasis, such as abandoning the desire for cosmic colonialism and supremacy to reduce energy demands. Regardless of the outcomes, it is within the interest of the civilization in question to remain silent; as the proverb goes, silence is golden. Therefore, detecting extraterrestrial intelligence only becomes increasingly challenging from a remote distance, like playing hide-and-seek in a dark room, except the room is as far and wide as the universe.  

## A Dark Forest

The list of solutions in response to the Fermi Paradox is extensive. One particular explanation that I would like to emphasize upon alludes to the sci-fi trilogy *Remembrance of Earth's Past* written by Liu Cixin, featuring a technologically advanced alien civilization called Trisolarans and their contact with Earth.  

## Aliens as Gods

hello

> "It is pointless to worry about the possible malevolent intentions of an advanced civilization with whom we might make contact. It is more likely that the mere fact they have survived so long means they have learned to live with themselves and others. Perhaps our fears about extraterrestrial contact are merely a projection of our own backwardness, an expression of our guilty conscience about our past history: the ravages that have been visited on civilizations only slightly more backward than we." â€• Carl Sagan
